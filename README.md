# Project Imitation

In this project, you will be creating your own CSS stylesheet for the [IACS CSS Zen Garden](https://iacs-zen-garden.netlify.app/).

The game is simple: show just how much you can do using only CSS to create a unique look and feel for a page. You may *not* edit the `index.html` file.

The Zen Garden itself contains the project instructions, but here they are again for your reference:

## Requirements

- Create at least one beautiful design
- Make the design selector menu beautiful and usable
- Use images and color wisely in your design

## Honors Requirements

- Make your designs responsive
- Create 3 unique designs using at least two different approaches to layout.
